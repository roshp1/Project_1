Our goal is to create a quant model based on a factor that has a strong positive or negative relationship with the U.S. equity market. Based on the relationship, we can make a buy or sell recommendation on the S&P500 Index. The instrument to buy or sell is the SPY ETF which is an ETF based on the S&P500 Index. 

However, we want to find an EDGE, i.e. find a factor that separates us from the crowd. We want to determine a factor that is not a popular factor used by investors.

If we use the same factors everyone uses then we can’t outperform them.

Our thesis is to see if the Federal Reserve’s bond buying (QE) program – Quantitative Easing – had the biggest impact (factor) on stock market returns. The QE program began after the financial crisis in 2008. We feel the Fed’s bond buying program is an EDGE factor.

Thesis: Whenever the Fed makes an announcement to buy, expand, or taper back QE, it impacts the financial markets more so than other macro-economic factors, i.e. interest rates, GDP, and inflation. 

If you google which factors have biggest impact on stock markets, typically these 3 macro factors – interest rates, GDP, and inflation – always show up. Most models used these 3 macro factors.

We compared and analysed individually these 3 macro factors along with Fed announcements versus the S&P500 to see which one has the biggest impact on financial markets.

Since the Fed’s QE program began after the 2008 financial crisis, we wanted to see if the 3 macro-economic factors had a larger impact on the S&P500 before 2009. This allows us to see if the Fed’s program impacted these three macro-economic factors. Thus, we have 2 databases: pre-2009 and post-2009. We used 2009 as the reference market bottom occurred in 2009.

Along the way, we did a pivot. 

We witnessed that the four analysed factors – Fed announcements, interest rates, GDP, and inflation – did not have a strong relationship with the market index. Though, we came upon the VIX (Volatility) Index, which had a strong inverse relationship with the market index that enabled us to create a model to recommend a buy or sell recommendation on the S&P500. 

Our EDGE factor is the VIX Index.
